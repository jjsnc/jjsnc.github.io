title: TryHackMe: Basic Pentesting Room

I have decided to skip the TryHackMe Linux Fundamentals and jump into a basic room (CTF Challenge) about pentesting. Pentesting involves getting into a target machine (with their permission, of course) to find vulnerabilities and evaluate the security measures in place. To simulate this environment, I played with the Basic Pentesting Room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt).

FYI, this was my first time really interacting with the tools used in this room, and thus, my explanations/methodology may contain errors or be very simple.

Before diving in, we must start the vulnerable machine on TryHackMe, which will give us the target machine's IP Address. IP Addresses, in simple terms, are basically unique labels given to every device on a network that uses the internet to communicate. In my case, I was given `10.201.103.124`.

With this IP Address, we can do reconnaissance on the vulnerable machine with `nmap`. `nmap` is a popular tool used by cybersecurity experts to scan the network. `nmap` has many different flags/options for different types of scans; we will be using the most basic scan with no flags.

```markdown
nmap [target ip]
```
Running `nmap 10.201.103.124` would result in the following:

As you can see, nmap has mapped out the network ports for the target IP Address. Specifically, we see that `10.201.103.124` utilizes ports 22, 80, 139, 445, 8009, and 8080 with their respective services.

Since `10.201.103.124` utilizes `http`, `ajs`, and `http proxy`, there is a very likely chance that there is a webpage available. This can be done by visiting `10.201.103.124` on a browser. However, there really isn't any information on the webpage, just plaintext. Even with `ctrl+u`, nothing really stands out, just standard html.

Since there is a webpage available, we could use another tool called `dirb` to brute-force and scan possible additional webpages on a web server; however, it was painfully slow, so I switched to `gobuster`. Rather than testing words one by one, `gobuster` utilizes parallelism to brute-force (testing 4 at once, etc).

```markdown
gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist]
dir indicates directory bruteforcing mode; there are many different modes
-u [URL] specifies the target URL, in this case http://10.201.103.124
-w [wordlist] indicates what wordlist you would bruteforce with
```

After running `gobuster`, we see a few hits. We can ignore hits with `Status: 403` since we would not be able to access them; however, we did get a hit on `/development`. We can also ignore `/index.html` because that is the homepage that was originally served up when we visited `10.201.103.124`.

So, the next thing I did was visit `/development`, which can be done by simply adding `/development` to the end of the URL of the homepage we visited. After navigating to `/development`, we see the following:

![dev directory](images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/browser.png)<br>

We can then open up the text files called `j` and `dev`, which show the following...

![dev directory](images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/devtxt.png)<br>
![dev directory](images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/misctxt.png)<br>

In these text files, we are given a few hints. Users K and J are communicating, and `SMB` has been set up. `SMB` stands for Service Message Block; it is a network file sharing protocol that allows computers on a network to access/share files, printers, etc. (You could also probably guess that `SMB` was set up just from the `nmap` scan with ports 445 and 139). Additionally, J has a weak password.

This gives us another direction, specifically, we could connect to the server's SMB service with `smbclient`.

```markdown
smbclient -L //[target] -N
-L lists all directories in target
-N presents directories that can be seen without a password
```

By doing `smbclient -L //10.201.103.124 -N`, I get the following:

![smbclient results](/images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/smb.png)<br>

We see two shares. A share is basically a folder/resource that is accessible over the network. One called Anonymous and another called IPC$. I went into Anonymous because IPC$ felt like something the computer would create automatically for running a certain system (in this case, we see that it is a Samba Server).

![anonymous directory in smb](/images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/smb2.png)<br>

As you can see, we can use `smbclient` again to get into a particular share. The syntax would be along the lines of `smbclient -L //[ip]/[sharename] -N`.

From the `Anonymous` directory, we see something called `staff.txt` and two directories called `.` and `..` (representing the current directory and the parent directory, respectively). The `D` and `N` labels stand for directory and normal file.

We have a `staff.txt` file in the directory, so the next action would be naturally - open it up...

We can use the command `more` to open up a file to view it (paging the file).

![staff txt file](/images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/openedstafftxt.png)<br>

As you can see, we now know what users J and K stand for - Jan and Kay. We could also probably assume that these are their usernames, and since we know that Jan has a weak password, we can try and brute-force Jan's password. This can be done with `hydra`, a password brute-forcer.

![hydra specifications](/images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/hydra.png)<br>

There are a ton of options, but I used: 
```markdown
hydra -l jan -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz ssh://10.201.103.124 -f -v -t 8
-l [user] specifies to login with user
-P [wordlist] specifies to brute-force with password list
-f is a flag that tells hydra to stop once a valid password has been guessed
-t [num] sets the number of parallel tasks hydra will use when attempting logins
-v stands for verbose, basically tells hydra to print additional info in terminal when it runs
```

If we do not specify `-t [num]` or use a number that is too high, we can run into potential problems with timing out and losing connection. I ran `hydra` without the `-t` flag and ran into problems:

![hydra ssh timeouts](/images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/hydraerror.png)<br>

However, with the correct specifications and time, we were able to derive a password for the user `jan`.

![hydra ssh timeouts](/images/THM%3A%20BasicPenTest/hydrasuccess.png)<br>

The password for `jan` is `armando`. We can now `ssh` into their machine...

`ssh jan@10.201.103.124` and when prompted with a password, we use `armando`.

Now that we are successfully in, we need to perform Linux Enumeration, which is basically reconnaissance after breaking in. Gathering information about the system, user accounts, services, permissions, and more to identify vulnerabilities.

I personally followed a checklist: [Checklist by Pacific Cybersecurity](https://cyberlab.pacific.edu/resources/linux-enumeration-cheat-sheet).
