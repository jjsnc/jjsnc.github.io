During this week's cybersecurity club meeting (UMDSEC), we looked over the basics of pentesting and reviewed tools, such as `nmap` and `metasploit`. I already have some experience with using `nmap`, but the meeting delved deeper, and more importantly, it went over `metasploit`, a very versatile exploitation framework, which I have no experience working with.

So yeah, this blog will basically be me tackling an exercise found in [UMDSEC's metasploit workshop](https://github.com/CSEC-President/csec-msf-workshop) in attempts to familiarize myself with `metasploit`.

The [exercise](https://github.com/franc205/pivoting-lab) is about `pivoting` - when an attacker uses one compromised system to `pivot` or to move across to another system that they couldn't reach directly.

Anyways, the setup's fairly simple, just follow the guide in the exercise. Once you have finished the setup, check that the Docker containers are running by running `docker ps`. If that doesn't work due to a lack of permissions, run `sudo docker ps`, in which case, you should see 10 containers.

After that, we can finally start by sshing into the attacker's pc - `ssh -p 2222 root@127.0.0.1` with `toor` as password.

This scenario assumes that we have already compromised another user's pc, `Jerry-PC`, and thus have all the credentials to get initial access into the target network.

```markdown
ssh root@192.168.10.3
User: root
Password: IAmJerry
```

We can then perform basic network reconnaissance with ifconfig to determine what `Jerry-PC` can connect to.

Here, we see our own IP Address, `192.168.10.3`, with a subnet mask of `255.255.255.0`. This means a network of `/24`, 24 bits dedicated to the network, and 8 to hosts. This means the range of our IP Address for this subnet encompasses `192.168.10.[1-254]`, 192.168.10.0 and 192.168.10.255 are reserved for network address and broadcast address, respectively.

Additionally, we see that `Jerry-PC` has an open connection to `192.168.11.2`
