# Firewall and Network Segmentation Lab (under construction)
A walkthrough and step-by-step guide for migrating an existing Active Directory (AD) domain behind a pfSense firewall, an open-source firewall and routing platform based on FreeBSD. This project will allow me to re-architect the network topology of an existing Active Directory domain to introduce network segmentation, routing, and security controls.
