# Migrating an Active Directory Domain Behind a pfSense Firewall

I will be assuming that you have an existing Active Directory Domain and that you would like to put a firewall between the domain and the Internet. However, if you do not have an existing Active Directory Domain, you can check out my [previous project](https://jjsnc.github.io/projects/windowsAD/) to build one from scratch, or you may follow along with just pfSense and a Windows 11 client (specific steps will differ, but general procedures will likely be similar).
