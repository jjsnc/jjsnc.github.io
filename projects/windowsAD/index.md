# Windows Active Directory (AD) Lab
Project will be broken up into subparts:

Introduction: What will be required for the lab, what even is AD, etc. <br> <br>
Server Setup: Configuring our Windows Server 2022 into an AD+DNS Server, and configuring a static IP address. <br> <br>
User/Client Setup: Reassign DNS for workstations to point to AD+DNS Server, creating new users within ADUC, joining the domain as new users, and logging into the domain.
